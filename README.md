# MySQL

[MySQL](https://MySQL.org) is one of the most popular database servers in the world. Notable users include Wikipedia, Facebook and Google.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a single node MySQL deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.10+ with Beta APIs enabled
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release ./minikube-mysql
```

The command deploys MySQL on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

By default password is set to 'root' for the root user. If you'd like to set your own password change the password in the mysql-root-secret.yaml.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete --purge my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release completely.

## Persistence

The [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) image stores the MySQL data and configurations at the `/var/lib/mysql` path of the container.

By default a PersistentVolumeClaim is created and mounted into that directory. In order to disable this functionality
you can change the values.yaml to disable persistence and use an emptyDir instead.

> *"An emptyDir volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a Node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. When a Pod is removed from a node for any reason, the data in the emptyDir is deleted forever."*

**Notice**: You may need to increase the value of `livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds` when enabling persistence by using PersistentVolumeClaim from PersistentVolume with varying properties. Since its IO performance has impact on the database initialization performance. The default limit for database initialization is `60` seconds (`livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds` + `livenessProbe.periodSeconds` * `livenessProbe.failureThreshold`). Once such initialization process takes more time than this limit, kubelet will restart the database container, which will interrupt database initialization then causing persisent data in an unusable state.
